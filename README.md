## ST-MoE - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08906">ST-MoE</a>, the final incarnation of mixture of experts after years of research at Brain, in Pytorch. Will be largely a transcription of the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/mesh/blob/master/mesh_tensorflow/transformer/moe.py">official Mesh Tensorflow implementation</a>. If you have any papers you think should be added, while I have my attention on mixture of experts, please open an issue.
